Starter Html Project Using Gulp-sass, Gulp, Html, Autoprefixer, and BrowserSync

# Dev Dependencies
1. Gulp - Gulp is a Node task runner. It is a streaming build system in front-end web development. It helps automate such tasks as copying files, minifying JavaScript code, or compiling TypeScript or CoffeeScript to JavaScript.

2. Sass - Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Sass has two syntaxes; the older syntax uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules.The newer syntax, SCSS, uses block formatting like CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.

3. The gulp-sass plugin - The gulp-sass is a Gulp plugin for compiling Sass to CSS. Internally it uses the node-sass module.
